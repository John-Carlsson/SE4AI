\section{Combined Emotion Recognition}
Finally, we aim to develop a combined system for facial and speech emotion recognition, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:whole-system}. To do this we will first develop the separate facial and speech emotion recognition models as seen above. Once we have trained these models, we will try to integrate them into a single system and will then evaluate the performance of the combined system using standard evaluation metrics like precision and recall. Apart from that, we will again give the users the opportunity to give feedback through the GUI.
