Emotional recognition is an emerging field of research that uses artificial intelligence algorithms to detect and interpret human emotions. As the metaverse
continues to evolve, emotional recognition is becoming increasingly important in creating a more immersive and engaging virtual environment. By using
AI algorithms to analyze facial expressions and other physiological responses, emotional recognition technology can enhance the social interactions and
emotional experiences of users in the metaverse. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and interact in virtual
spaces, creating a more human-like experience.
