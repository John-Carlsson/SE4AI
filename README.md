Facial detection: 

Some documentation for nnmodel.py: 

This file is ment to act as a type of playground for trying out different models for facial emotion detection. 

We have the class NNmodel that contains some fundamental functions for training NN for facial emotion detection. 
Sofar only one (sequential) model is implemented, which provides a 66% accuracy on the validation set. This is 
quite good, since our expectation is an accuracy of 70%. 

train_model() saves the trained model and returns the path of the trained model.
[Note: training this model takes approx. 30 min.]

TODO:
  - Documentation missing
  - Write discriptions for the functions
  - cleanup package imports 
  - Implement a efficient file reader, i.e. a way to import different datasets and process these sets.
  - Make predictions on the test-data (visulisation)
  - [maybe split the model and training into two different functions]
