%As seen in the previous section \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} is a relevant research area within various applications and fields. 
In this section, we will present the methodology for developing both a facial- and a speech emotion recognition system. Consequently, this section discusses the several methodical steps that need to be taken to address the research questions and reach the research goals.
%this section discusses several steps, for example data collection, preprocessing, modeling and model evaluation, including the user feedback. 


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection:}
    The first step in the project report is the data collection. This step is relevant, because the performance of emotion recognition models is highly dependent on the quality and diversity of the dataset used to train them. Therefore, it is necessary to collect a large and diverse dataset of both facial and speech emotional expressions to train and test the models. During the data collection process, the licence to use the corresponding data is considered.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Preprocessing:}
    Secondly comes the data preprocessing, which is crucial for cleaning and preparing the collected data for training the model. This step may involve data augmentation and feature extraction, depending on the specific techniques used for \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser}. Data preprocessing is also essential for ensuring that the dataset is balanced and is a main step to ensure the model can generate good results.
    
    \item \textbf{Model and System Implementation:}
    The next crucial step is the implementation and training of the \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} models. Hereby, different machine learning frameworks may be used. Lastly, both models will be integrated into two individual pipelines that should be able to process real-time data streams and predict the according emotion of the user. 
    
    \item \textbf{Model Evaluation:}
    The model evaluation, which is the fourth phase, aids in determining how well the \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} models operate, utilizing evaluation criteria like accuracy, precision, and recall. Model evaluation is crucial for deciding which models are best suitable and for identifying any weaknesses or potential areas for improvement.
        
    \item \textbf{Deployment:}
    Thereafter, the final application will be deployed, whereby the \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} models will be integrated into a single system. Deployment is essential for testing the system's performance in real-world scenarios and verifying that the models can work together effectively and the feedback system works.
    
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:}
    Lastly, the final step is a continuous improvement of the system. This involves continually updating and improving the \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} models e.g. through user feedback. This step may later also involve monitoring the system's performance, as well as adding new features and functionality to the system. Continuous improvement is essential for ensuring that the \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} models can adapt to new data and different real-world scenarios and can continue to perform well over time, which is according to our research goal. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent By following these steps, we aim to develop a robust and accurate system that can recognize emotions from facial expressions and speech signals and can be used in various applications such as healthcare, marketing and security.
