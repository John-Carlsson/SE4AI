\noindent As seen in the previous section \acrshort{fer} and \acrshort{ser} is a relevant research area within various applications and fields. In this section, we will present the methodology for developing both a facial- and a speech emotion recognition system. Consequently, this section discusses several steps, for example data collection, preprocessing, modeling and model evaluation, including the user feedback. By following this pipeline, we aim to develop a robust and accurate system that can recognize emotions from facial expressions and speech signals and can be used in various applications such as healthcare, marketing and security.

\section{Combined Emotion Recognition}
Finally, we aim to develop a combined system for facial and speech emotion recognition, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:whole-system}. To do this we will first develop the separate facial and speech emotion recognition models as seen above. Once we have trained these models, we will try to integrate them into a single system and will then evaluate the performance of the combined system using standard evaluation metrics like precision and recall. Apart from that, we will again give the users the opportunity to give feedback through the GUI. Overall, we aim to develop a robust and accurate combined system for facial and speech emotion recognition that can be applied to a range of real-world applications.
